Canned Soup
===========

Example project for Beautiful Soup web scrapers packaged as native apps using BeeWare.

To create your own native app for a single web scraping task, replace the URL and 
Beautiful Soup data extraction code in cannedsoup.soupspoon.py. Then test and build
as described in the BeeWare documentation.
